Q: Explain what the following code does:

```
((n & (n - 1)) == 0)
```


Well my first instinct says that it tests whether `n` is a power of two. This is because `(n-1)` clears the lowest-order bit and replaces all bits below that with ones. E.g.

```
n   = 101100100
n-1 = 101100011 
```

So `n & (n - 1)` is effectively clearing the lowest-order bit that was set in `n`. If `n` without its lowest order bit is 0, then `n` must only have had a single bit set and is thus a power of 2. 

Note that if `n` is already 0, then the quantity will also be zero because `(n-1)` will be -1, which is all 1's. So the operation really checks whether `n` is a power of two *or* `n` is 0.
