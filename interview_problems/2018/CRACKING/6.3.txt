Placing 31 dominoes into an 8x8 board with opposite corners shaved off wouldn't work.

Here's why.

Each domino needs a "complete color pair" to be placed. A complete color pair
       is an adjacent + free white & black. 

The thing is, with opposite corners shaved off, the number of colors is now unequal. 

So the number of complete w/b pairs is less than the number of dominoes. 

So there aren't enough spots to place all the dominoes.
