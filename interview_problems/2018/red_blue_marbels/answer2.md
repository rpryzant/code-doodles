Question: You have 50 red marbles, 50 blue marbles and 2 jars. One of the jars is chosen at random and then one marble will be chosen from that jar at random. How would you maximize the chance of drawing a red marble? What is the probability of doing so? All 100 marbles should be placed in the jars.

p(r) = p(r|1) + p(r|2)
       49/100 * 1/2 + 1/1 * 1/2
       49/200 + 1/2
       149/200
