2 ropes
each rope takes 1 hours to burn
ropes burn unevenly

how to time 15mins?



with 1 rope:
    1 hour (light at one end)
    30mins (light at both ends)

    15mins (light at both ends and middle?) ?? assume no

can time
1 hr
2 hrs
0.5 hr
1.5 hr

solution is going to involve staggering ropes..

light one at 1 end, the other at 2 ends, once 30mins is up light the opposite end of the 1st. 15mins remainng because thatâ€™s a 30min rope left
