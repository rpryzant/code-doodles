"""find dups


N = max num (unknown)
A = array size (known...big)
M = memory (4kb ~ 4k numbers if short)


O(A * (N/M)): 
	for each pass of array look for numbers in [i*m, (i+1)*m]


what can i use the mem for? holding
	indices
	numbers from A
		^^ similar, but not identical as dups have same number but dif index
	
	counts
		most space efficient
		doesnâ€™t require second dup-finding pass


problem! donâ€™t know N -- how many passes?
	find max O(1)
