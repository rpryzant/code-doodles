A blue finger will grow out of your stomach.
Cows will rule the world.
A black hole will swallow your house.
He who throws dirt is losing ground.
Gnomes will turn your grass pink. Stay inside.
Your proteins will internally combust.
A cynic is only a frustrated optimist.
A closed mouth gathers no feet.
He who laughs last is laughing at you.
A woman who seeks to be equal with men lacks ambition.
It's raining cats and dogs. Really.
When in doubt, go left.
Have a doctor look at that rash.
Avoid ham.
Your inability to avoid ham will prove fatal.
Mom's goldfish will become a great communist leader.
You will become an old lady with 27 cats.
