==== TF-IDF

=== OVERVIEW
- means "term frequency-inverse document frequency"
- evals how important a word is to a document in a collection/corpus
- importance goes up with document frequency, but offset by corpus frequency


=== HOW TO COMPUTE

- 2 parts:
    1) Term Frequency (TF): how frequently a term occurs in a document. Normalized by doc length

         TF(t) = (# occurances of t in the document) / (# terms in the document)

    2) Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): how important a term is on a global basis. downweights
        stuff like "is" and "of

       	 IDF(t) = log(  # documents  /  # documents with t in it )


- then the TF-IDF score of a query is 
      
         ****  TF(t) * IDF(t)   ******
