* scoring with *jaccard coefficient*
  * |A ^ B | / |A union B|
  * ~proportion of elements in A and B that are shared
* not a very good metric
  * doesn't considers term *frequency* (how many times a term occures in a document)
  * normalization by dividing by union isn't quite right
    * square root of union is better because its closer to cosine similarity
