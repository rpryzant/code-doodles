* shakespere example
  * what plays contain X and Y but *not* Z?
  * you could grep, but that's unrealistic for web-scale search
* *term document matrix*
  * rows = terms
  * cols = documents
  * cells are 1 if that word appears in that document
  * makes answering boolean queries like that shakespere thing easy
  * but breaks for large collections 
    * b/c matrix is too big
* matrix is sparse though, so only store the locations where cells are active (1)
