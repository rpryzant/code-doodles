* document frequency (used in reverse) so *inverse doc frequency*
* note that rare words are more informative than frequent words
* so want to give a high weight to rare terms, low weight to frequent terms (less informative)
* df = document frequency = # docs that contain that term
* ` idf = log(N / df)` - having df in denom makes less frequent words *more* important
* another measure: *collection frequency*
  * total number of occurances of a term in the corpus
  * not normally used in IR
  * because document freq is more informative. 
    * low doc frequency and high corpus frequency implies there are documents *about* that query
    * collection frequency doesn't capture this
