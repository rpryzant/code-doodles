* now we have a |V|-dimensional vector space for each document
* very high dimensional, and very sparse
* queries are also vectors in the space
* how to find distance
  * euclidean distances?
    * no, because distance might be large if they're pointing in same direction, but that really means they're similar (similar words, just in different numbers)
  * so use *angle* in the vector space instead
* cosine starts at *1* then keeps going *down* until it hits *180*
  * so cosine is monitonically decreasing between 0 and 180, so it's the *opposite* of angle
* how to compute
  * dot product on top
  * length normalization on bottom (|A| * |B|)
  * that's equivilant to normalizing each vector, than dotting those normalized vectors
