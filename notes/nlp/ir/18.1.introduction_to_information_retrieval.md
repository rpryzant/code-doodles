* IR is getting information from unstructured text
* goal: retreive documents relevant to user's need
  * e.g. get rid of mice = goal
    * information need: want to know about how to get ride of mice w/o killing them
    * translate need into *query*
    * iterate on your query 
* how to evalute (F2)
  * *precision*
    * fraction of retrieved docs relevant to users _need_
  * *recall*
    * fraction of relevant docs are retrieved
  * these have to be evaluated w/r/t users _needs_
