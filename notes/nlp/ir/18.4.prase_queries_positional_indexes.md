* phrase queries
  * e.g. i want to go to "stanford univeristy" includes the entire phrase in "..."
  * implicit phrase queries are there too, e.g. San Fransisco
* could build biword postings lists
  * problem: dictionary blows up (num words squared)
  * ==> biword indixes aren't standard soln
* better soln: *positional index*
  * term: doc freq => docID: [indices where it occurs]
  * then match up index occurances
  * this by progressively intersecting the two retrieved postings lists
  * *COST*: postings list just got a *lot* larger. thats fine, though, because positional index is on disk
  * positional index size depends on document size
  * up to ~50% of the original text (pretty big!)
