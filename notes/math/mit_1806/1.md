* prelude
  * i remember this being a super helpful lecture
  * "row picture" and "column picture" of solving equations is ALWAYS worth revisiting
* row picture
  * regular picture, two equations, two lines, find the point where they cross
* column picture
  * find the right amound of each column to produce `b`
  * the right **linear combination**
  * whats the picture? columns (vectors) are "arrows" in space. Find find a linear combo of those arrows that gets to the end point of a `b` arrow
* what about 3x3 equations?  (3 eqs, 3 vars)
  * row picture
    * all the points that solve **one** of the variables are a **plane**
    *  all the points that solve another row are another **plane**
    * intersection of those two plantes givces you a **line** of solutions
    * 3rd equation, 3rd plane, intersection is a **point**
  * column picture
    * `x`, `y`, `z`, amount of each column to produce `b`, the taret
    * ==> linear combo of 3 vectors to produce target
    * ==> linear combo of 3 arrows in a volumne
* the big picture: what if you swap out `b` (right hand side)?
  * can you solve `Ax = b` for **every** `b`?
  * do linear combinations of columns fill the entire space?
  * does column space **span** the space?
* WHEN YOU MULTIPLY A MATRIX BY A COLUMN VECTOR YOU GET A **COMBINATION OF ITS COLUMNS**
* **singular** matrices are **not** invertable
* matrix form
  * `Ax`: matrix * column vector
    * 1: combination of columns of A
    * 2: dot products - each row of the matrix dotted with the vector is an element of outgoing vector
