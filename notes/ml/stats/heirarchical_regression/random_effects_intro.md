* example
  * predicting house price at a point in time
  * want to be controlling across time
  * remove alpha with "first differences" or "fixed effects"?
  * alpha is some other variable that's correlated with our features
  * assume no covariance b/t alpha and features
    * just use least squares to fit the model!
* alpha is part of the error? we don't see it?
  * covariance between errors 
* hmm not really understanding this...dropping this
