* **localization and detection**
  * find all instances of objects in an image AND draw a bounding box around it
  * localization: 1 or fixed num objects
  * detection: variable num objects (harder than localization)
  * imagenet also has classification/localization challenge
* **localization**
  * localization is framed as regression
  * produce 4 numbers to describe box, ground truth is 4 numbers, can do regular l2 loss on this
  * attatch 2 fc layers to end of conv stack
    * one does class scores
    * other does boxes
    * at test time, go forward through both fc heads (classification head + box head) 
  * where to attach regression head?
    * after last conv layer OR after last fc layer from classification part of the network
    * either works fine, you could probably attach it anywhere
  * localizing **multiple objects**
    * easy if you have a set num of objects: just regress on each box!
    * used for things like human pose estimation
  * **sliding window localization**
    * network is: alexnet, regression head (bounding boxes), classification head
    * run it on sliding windows over image. end up with several bounding boxes. then combine bounding boxes. helps network correct its own errors and generally works well
    * problem: this is expensive
      * soln: convert fc layers to conv layer (transpose it, get 4096 x 1 x 1 feature map)
      * now there's nothing but conv layers in there
      * so can handle variable sized input



* **object detection**
  * want to find all instances of objects of different classes in an image
  * problem: can't do straight up regression because variable number of regression targets
    * we can do classification though: run sliding window over image, classify each one. problem is, CNN forward pass is slow
    * soln **region proposals**: find "blobs" in the image that might correspond to objects
    * can do this quickly: e.g. selective search: merge similar pixels to segment teh region
  * putting it together: R-CNN
    * get an image
    * run region proposal to get a bunch of boxes
    * run cnn over each region, have regression + classification head for each one
    * how to train the cnn: 
      * pretrain for classification
      * fine-tune model for detection
      	* run on pos/neg regions from your detection dataset
      * extract features from each region with cnn
      * train one binary svn per class to classify region features (does this region contain or not contain my object?)
      * corrections: regress on correction vector which translates bounding box to fine-tune things
  * remaining problems: slow at test time, complex to train. soln: **Fast R-CNN**
    * run entire image through big cnn, run region proposal etc on last high-resolution feature map
    * can train end-to-end!
    * **146x** faster at test time!! (with region proposal **25x**)
  * **Faster R-CNN**
    * region proposal network 
      * recieve as input conv feature map
      * 2 heads: classification (is this an object) and regression (regress back to pos in original image)
    * everything else is like fast R-CNN
    * **250x** speedup over R-CNN!!!	
    * does about the same performance wise

* **YOLO - you only look once**
  * detection as regression
  * didn't quite catch all of that
  * lets you do real-time detection (very cool!!)
